Not a HORSE RACE is a bidding game where things such as 'skill' do not exist.
Given that, this is a really fun game, please give it a try.

The way you play is simple, you choose the number of partecipants by clicking on the image of a characters
(faded out characters are not in-game) and then you bid completely worthless currency on who you think is the fastest cowboy of them all.
Once you (and your friends!) have placed the bets you can start playing. Click the start button and watch the partecipating characters
run on the magnificent and astonishing circular track as they fight for their pride, honor and your value-less money.

The first cowboy to complete one lap will be the winner and the amount of cash won will be displayed on the screen (magnificent!).
If you are the winner you will know that all it took you was luck but you can still brag with your friend about how well-thought was your choiche.
If you lost you can blame it on the blindfolded goddess and ask a referee for a rematch (sweet).

Please let us know if you have any suggestions for us on how to improve our game (link in bio.)
